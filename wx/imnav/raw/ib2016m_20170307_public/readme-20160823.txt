== Funding Sources ==
=====================
Stations were originally established as part of the Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Services and National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs program. 
Stations are currently (2015-present) funded by US Fish and Wildlife Service through the Arctic LCC, grant number F15AC00347

Several other grants have supported ongoing data collection:
Franklin Bluffs station were maintained through funding for project "Using Snow Fences to Augment Fresh Water Supplies in Shallow Arctic Lakes" by Department of Energy (DOE) Award Number DE-NT0005684 (2008-2014)

    ===============================
    == Data Collection Procedure ==
    ===============================
        For both research regions early data collection was limited to on-site data retrieval. 
Beginning in 2000 a Freewave FGR series 900 MHz radio network was incrementally installed 
 for automated data retrieval.  In 2015, iridium and cellular telemetry was installed at various stations.

        Data is also collected locally/manually during stations visits, which occur several times annually 
generally during the April to September period.  

    ====================================================
    == Derived Parameters and Mathematical Operations ==
    ====================================================
Eppley PIR Longwave Radiometers had a lead-mercury installed annually to 
temperature correct the longwave radiation signal.  In 2007 the Upper Kuparuk (UK) 10m Met site, Franklin Bluffs (FB) 10m site and Imnavait (IB) 10m site 
were rewired and reprogrammed to use the thermistor in the PIR rather than the battery.

        For most years Eppley PIR and PSP calibration 
constants to convert sensor signal from milliVolt output to radiation (W/m^2) was done on the logger 
during program run-time.

        Net Radiation is logged in milliVolts and sensor calibration values as well as wind speed 
correction are applied during QA/QC in Fairbanks.

        Soil Temperatures are logged with units of both resistance in kilo-Ohms and temperature in degrees C.  On the logger the 
milli-Volt signal of the sensors are converted to resistance.  

        Snow signal is recorded as distance in centimeters to ground / snow surface.  Sensor distance to 
ground is recalculated every fall.

    =====================
    == Parameter units ==
    =====================
      Radiation: Watts per meter squared
      Temperature: Degrees Celsius
      Relative Humidity: Percent
      Precipitation: millimeters of water
      Snow Depth: centimeters of snow
      Wind Speed: meters per second
      Wind Direction: degrees
      Soil Moisture: Percent 
      Stage: feet 
      Discharge: cubic meters per second

Generally the quality of the data is thought to be very good.  During the late fall, winter and early 
spring air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction sensors can all experience rime ice or 
freezing precipitation.  When this occurs the data collected by these sensors may be adversely affected.  
Sensor outages occur periodically due to animal damage and equipment failure.

Position information recorded in the field using a GPS (WGS84).  Elevation information estimated from topographic 
maps (NAD27 or NAD83).
