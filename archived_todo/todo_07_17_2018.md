###### Validation

-  Incorporate rock vs. depth results
-  Determine if filtering decreases errors
-  Include first order comments from MS
-  What happens when a pixel has no corresponding magna-depth? Culled from the analysis?  How about when it has two or more magn-depths?
-It seems like in the geographic effect analysis it would be better to use smaller, more targeted sub-areas.  Like take the Imnavait grid where we know the east-facing slope will be order 2X the west-facing slope: any difference in the offset? I suspect not (see the HV stream vs. watertrack areas), but I think rather than using geographic domains as the basis for the comparison, depth classes zones makes more sense.
-  I did not understand for the several azimuth directions what the offset is plotted against.
-   You are primarily comparing "normal" statistics in you table...which is good. You can add a few metrics that can compare the "shape" of the distribution curves and this would be useful. Skewness, kurtosis and peakedness will do some of this.  I think there are some other specific curve to curve tests you can try.  I don't think in this section you need to really decide if the pdfs are normal vs. log normal or Weibul etc.
-  You don't discuss at all the potential magnprobe GPS error (which I suppose is larger than SfM location error?).  I just did that section in the magnaprobe paper and it is order Â±2 m. In comparing normal statistics with large n-values, these errors probably don't impact the analysis, but I know for Trail Valley, you looked at more local comparisons and whether shifts in one set of data re: the other was producing apparent errors. I think that examination should be included.
-  In thinking how this might go from where it is now to an appendix in the thesis, a couple of additions/improvements suggest themselves. The first is to start with a discussion that recognizes there is no "truth" depth field. All of these fields have errors. In Sveta's paper, that is the problem, as she used a very harsh and unrealistic measure for over-probe...one that ensured the value would be large because I know (I worked on this) she believed that was the nature of the error going into the paper. Start with that discussion, perhaps recognize that we have two goals in which errors might need to be known: a) do we from SfM produce reliable statistics (yes if we apply a fixed offset), and b) are our maps of snow depth realistic (probably yes also, but here the offset matters less than the map distribution of deep and shallow).  There isn't anything in the appendix about this latter question.
-  Extract 4 to 6 paragraphs and 2 figures + table that go in the paper proper. I think that starts with an opening paragraph (what's the error?), acknowledges that all systems have error and states that the magna tends to over-probe, does the "normal statistics comparison (which concludes we generally need to apply a fixed across space additive value), then digs into the whether we reproduce pdfs OK (I suspect we do), asks whether our maps are accurate (probably), and concludes with a couple of braod statements of how in the rest of the paper we are using values from SfM that have been corrected using XXXXX.

###### Figures
