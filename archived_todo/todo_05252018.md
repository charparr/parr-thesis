###### Validation

1.  Use validation result shapefiles to query terrain information for error analysis
2.  ~~Utlity script to sample raster(s) with points and write result.~~
3.  ~~Update GDAL terrain scripts to push 0 instead of -9999 for no data on slope, etc.~~
4.  ~~Generate pairplot of errors vs. terrain factors~~
5.  Make it several plots instead of pairplot...
6.  Smart names from study area args
7.  Include in bash script
8.  Decide what to do about HV 2016 where no validation data exist.
9.  Write Validation report.
10. Introduction of data
11. Methods
12. Report on results, table
13. Further error investigation
14. Discussion

###### Figures

1.  Make a utility to plot single and multi rasters

###### Analysis

1.  ~~Generate corrected rasters via validation script~~
2.  Create stack of depth dDEMS

###### Validation

~~1.  Decide what to do about HV 2016 where no validation data exist.~~
2\.  Check rocks, roads, for zero depths in corrected depth maps
3\.  Filter fork of Validation process
~~4.  First draft of Validation report.~~

###### Analysis

1.  Create stack of depth dDEMS

##### 5.24.2018

###### Validation

-   Check rocks in ortho for zero depths in corrected depth maps
    -   Create script to find 'black' areas in snow ortho
-   Determine if filtering decreases errors
-   Reorganize results and discussion in report. Right now they are far too mixed.

###### Figures

-   Make a utility to plot single and multi rasters

###### Analysis

-   Create stack of depth dDEMS
-   Apply offset to HV 2016
