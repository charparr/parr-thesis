# TODO
##### 5.16.2018
###### Validation
1. ~~Run validation for each year ~~CLPX~~ and HV~~
  1. ~~Check for existence of good UTM cols at HV~~
2. Investigate any high mean errors
  1. ~~Fix 2016 CLPX points. Right now they are computing depth using 'depthvolts'~~
3. ~~Refine plots with titles and statistics~~
4. ~~Configure option to write out a raster corrected by mean offset with smart filepaths.~~
5. ~~Create option to write validation results to csv and/or .shp~~
6. Make a utility to aggregate validation out_results
7. Create depth stacks of corrected dDEMS

##### 5.17.2018
###### Validation
1. Use validation result shapefiles to query terrain information for error analysis
  1. ~~Generate terrain surfaces for HV & CLPX~~
    1. ~~roughness surfaces~~
    2. ~~directional hillshades~~
    3. ~~slope~~
2. Add all validation result points to QGIS & assign zone labels if available to compare errors. e.g. are there greater errors in water tracks?
3. Write Validation report.

###### Figures
1. Make a utility to plot single and multi rasters
2. ~~Make aggregate validation plots~~

###### Analysis
1. Generate corrected rasters via validation script
2. Create stack of depth dDEMS

##### 5.18.2018
###### Validation
1. Use validation result shapefiles to query terrain information for error analysis
  1. Utlity script to sample raster with points and write result. Input single .tif or dir?
  2. Could make for a good pal plot
2. ~~Add all validation result points to QGIS & assign zone labels.~~
3. Write Validation report.
  1. Introduction of data
  2. Methods
  3. Report on results, table
  4. Further error investigation
  5. Discussion
  6.
