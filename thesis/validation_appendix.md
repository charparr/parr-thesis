For those familiar with ArcGIS, this is similar to the 'Extract Values to Points' geoprocessing tool, or the 'Point Sampler Plugin'
for QGIS.

 Errors are analyzed by year, study area, location within each study area, and topography.
 Special HV case is 2016 because we were logistically limited.

There were no MagnaProbe snow depth measurements for Happy Valley in 2016. The mean of all Happy Valley annual mean errors where there is field data is zero. Errors are more consistent through time than across study areas, so it is more sensible to use the other Happy Valley data to prescribe a zero correction than to use the CLPX 2016 data to inform the correction.
