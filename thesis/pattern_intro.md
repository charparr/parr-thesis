In our field areas we observe patterns of snow depth which repeat themselves with strong fidelity each winter. Snow patterns exist on the spatial scales ranging from contiental (10 4 km) (e.g. Greenland) to an individual bedform upon the snow surface (10 -4 km) and are driven by processes that function over time scales ranging from decadal (climate) to hourly (the drifting of snow in a storm). The mixture of these multi-scale processes produces the snow patterns in Nature.

Pattern Questions:
Do snow patterns exist in all snow classes?
What causes a pattern to be more or less similar from year to year? What can patterns tell us about snow processes?
What practical information can come from patterns?
How do snow patterns interact with other geographic patterns?
