# Introduction

One thing that is clear from our snow depth maps (Data - Figure 1) is that the snowcover is highly dissected into areas of deep and shallow snow. In a windy tundra snow environment like ours, these are areas of snowdrift and scour. These snowdrifts are considered 'fixed', because unlike snow surface bedforms (e.g. barchans, dunes, snow waves \[Filhol and Sturm, 2014\]) they remain in one location throughout the winter and require some change in topography to form. Snow, wind, and landscape generate such snowdrifts over much (get area of tundra + alpine (+ prairie?) snow classes) of the Earth's surface when a suffciently sudden change in the landscape disrupts the transport of windblown snow. The resulting eddy decreases the velocity of the of wind and snow, and snow is deposited into the catchment downwind of the terrain break (Figure 1).
