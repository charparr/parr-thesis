Snow cover over the Earth's land surface can encompass 66 million square kilometers, or about 45% of the land area on Earth, at its peak.  Much of our world is covered with snow - and that snow is a critical source of water and is also a cooling mechanism for the entire planet. A dependable snow cover also provides numerous ecosystem services and economic benefits. For several climate classes of snow (tundra, prairie, and alpine snowcovers) much of the snow mass is stored in fixed topographic snowdrifts for much of the winter and spring. In this research, high resolution maps of near peak (mid-April) seasonal snow depth (Figure 1) from two distinct Arctic tundra field areas on Alaskaâ€™s North Slope are used to analyze snowdrifts, their properties, and their relationships to the landscapes beneath them. Snow depth maps are computed by differencing snow-free surface elevations from snow-covered surface elevations, and from these drifts identified. Surface elevations are acquired by airborne remote sensing (both lidar and photogrammetry). Snow depth maps are validated using field measurements of snow depth collected concurrently with the snow-covered surfaces. Several operational definitions of drifts are applied to the data, which then allow quantification of snow stockpiled in drifts.  Between the two study areas there are twelve snow depth maps spanning seven years (2012 - 2018, except in 2014) which together are comprised of over 600 million snow depth records and are validated by 141,207 field measurements of snow depth.

The snow depth maps are used to assess the interannual variability (or lack thereof) of the seasonal tundra snowcover and to populate an inventory of fixed topographic snowdrifts. The results of the analysis and the snowdrift database will be used to inform the following research questions:


1. What drives the interannual variability or similarity of tundra snow depth patterns?
2. What specific aspects of landscape (elevation, topography, etc.) are important in the production of annual tundra snow depth patterns?
3. Based on (2), can specific aspects of landscape features be used to predict the annual snow depth patterns?
4. Are there patterns within the snowdrift database that produce clusters of snowdrift types, or that reveal common features of all snowdrift forms?
5. Are there landscapes that are more 'primed' for snowdrifts than others (e.g. optimal conditions for stockpiling snow in drifts)?
6. Are there landscape - snowdrift relationships that can be extrapolated or globalized to other types of domains?


These research questions will produce a better understanding of how snow is organized in environments where windblown snow is common. The research may also be able to improve snow transport models, hydrological models (snowmelt), and climate models where snow is an important parameter.
