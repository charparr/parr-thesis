### Preliminary Title: Landscape Driven Snowdrift Relationships
* * *

Peak snow coverage over Earth's landmass can encompass 66 million square kilometers, or about 45% of the land area on Earth. Snow on Arctic and Antarctic sea ice can add another 33 million square kilometers. Much of our world is covered with snow - and that snow is a critical source of water for much of the planet, and is as a cooling mechanism for the entire world. importa
A dependable snow cover also provides numerous ecosystem services and economic benefits. For several classes of snow (tundra, prairie, and alpine) much of the snow mass is stored in fixed topographic snowdrifts for much of the winter and spring. In this research, high resolution (1 m) maps of snow depth from two distinct Arctic tundra field areas are used to analyze snowdrifts, their properties, and their relationships to the landscapes beneath them. Snow depth maps are computed by subtracting a snow-free surface from a snow-covered surface. All surfaces were acquired by airborne remote sensing (lidar and phogrammetry). Snow depth maps are validated using the field data collected concurrently with the airborne snow-covered DSMs. Between the two study areas there are twelve snow depth maps collected over a span of seven years (2012 - 2018, except in 2014) which together are comprised of over 600 million snow depth records and are validated by 141,207 field measurements of snow depth.

These snow depth maps are used to assess the interannual variability of the seasonal tundra snowcover and to populate a inventory of snowdrifts. The results of the variability analysis and the snowdrift database will be used to inform the following research questions:

1. What drives the interannual variability or similarity of tundra snow depth patterns?
2. What role does landscape (elevation, topography, etc.) play in the production of annual tundra snow depth patterns?
3. Are there landscape features that are predictive of the annual snow depth patterns?
4. Are there patterns within the snowdrift database that produce clusters or snowdrift types, or that reveal common features of all snowdrift forms?
5. Are there landscapes that are more 'primed' for snowdrifts than others?

These research questions, if answered, will produce a better understanding of how snow (i.e. precipitation) is organized in environments where windblown snow is common. The research may also be able to improve models of snow transport, hydrological models where snowmelt is featured, and climate models where snow is an important parameter.
