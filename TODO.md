###### Validation
1. ~~Run validation for each year ~~CLPX~~ and HV~~
  1. ~~Check for existence of good UTM cols at HV~~
2. Investigate any high mean errors
  1. ~~Fix 2016 CLPX points. Right now they are computing depth using 'depthvolts'~~
3. ~~Refine plots with titles and statistics~~
4. ~~Configure option to write out a raster corrected by mean offset with smart filepaths.~~
5. ~~Create option to write validation results to csv and/or .shp~~
6. Make a utility to aggregate validation out_results
7. Create depth stacks of corrected dDEMS

##### 4.16.2018
###### Figures
1. Make a utility to plot single and multi rasters
2. Make aggregate validation plots

###### Analysis
1. Generate corrected rasters via validation script
2. Create stack of depth dDEMS
