# TODO

-   Apply new offset from new results to HV 2016 depth maps
-   Find a way to smooth DEM or depth maps
-   Wrap depth maps for Matthew
-   Send bullets for introduction to Matthew
-   Finish data.md
    -   Add note about creating depth stack products
      - Trim to where we have data for all years, i.e. if nan for one year then nan for every year
    - Recompute CLPX DEM and Depth maps
    - Fill in CLPX Appendices
-   Methods: Drift mapping
-   Methods: Similarity index
- 1. Create script to compare drift vs. not-drift area (and snow volume) for a variety of depth thresholds. The thresholds should be precentages of the mean depth value for the domain. This should generate simialr results to an experiment done at Tuolumne.
- 2. Use results of (1) to identify a drift inventory for each winter, and for a stack of all winters.
- 3. Generate statistics under each drift..what can we learn? Produce a summary table of drifts. Shape, size, mean depth, max depth, nearest neighbors, etc. (auto corre?)
-   Write Field Areas section

## Notes
CLPX DEM may be re-processed by Chris.
