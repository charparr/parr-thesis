### Writing
-   Send bullets for introduction to Matthew
    -   Review Old Documents for intro ideas
-   Field Areas
-   Methods
    -   Drift definition and inventory
    -   Similarity toolbox
-   We know from the above drift inventory and similarity toolbox that snow patterns repeat with high fidelity. What drives the fidelity?
    -   Must be something about the landscape
    -   So let's try a rf model of different landscape features

### Scripting / Coding
-   Random and Egg Carton Drift definition example
-   Compute drift inventory for each winter and stack of all winters
-   Report aggregate and individual statistics
-   Implement VRM topo metric    <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/110397/how-to-use-vector-ruggedness-measure-vrm-tool-from-arcscripts-at-latest-version>
-   In Whitebox GIS environment
    -   ~~Generate pit filled and smoothed DEMs (add to tool dict)~~
    -   Use above for Geomorphometric products where appropriate
-   Create showcase of tools where azimuth is specified (whitbox plus winstral, relative aspect, what was used by Lapen and Martz 2003, what was used by Winstral 2002?, erickson 2005?)
-   add any other ruggendess topo tools from other work
-   Structure where aois are generated --> geomorph tiles --> drift inventory --> rf model?

## Work (not science)
~~- Call Tupper to arrange delivery of one sled for Monday or Tuesday~~
~~- Call Ben to see if delivery to Tupper can take place Monday or Tuesday~~
~~- Other sleds come to UPark or Cold Storage (Brian)~~
- Amend Sled Cover PO with Katie Best
~~- Toolik Reservations ~~(pending Aly fund/org info)~~~~
- MagnaProbe parts purchase (batteries plus other items from Matthew)
- Two sled covers for repair (hear from Chris about cover conidition at Matthew's)

## Notes
Learn: Geographically Weighted Regressions, CI, CV

Explore histogram matching, extract valleys in whitebox tools.

Do drift center lines or mass centers match flow accumulation lines or a similar hydro metric?

Smooth depth maps (whitebox?)

Contribute similarity metrics to skimage
