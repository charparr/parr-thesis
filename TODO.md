# TODO
-   Finish data.md
  - control table size
  - Cull skew, kurt from map errors. format count as int and fix years from agg. table?
- Figures for appendices: DSM, Depth Maps, Stack Products
- Compress depth map folder and send to committee
-   Send bullets for introduction to Matthew
-   Methods: Drift mapping
-   Methods: Similarity index
- 1. Create script to compare drift vs. not-drift area (and snow volume) for a variety of depth thresholds. The thresholds should be precentages of the mean depth value for the domain. This should generate simialr results to an experiment done at Tuolumne.
- 2. Use results of (1) to identify a drift inventory for each winter, and for a stack of all winters.
- 3. Generate statistics under each drift..what can we learn? Produce a summary table of drifts. Shape, size, mean depth, max depth, nearest neighbors, etc. (auto corre?)
-   Write Field Areas section

## Notes
Learn: Geographically Weighted Regressions

Find a way to smooth DEM or depth maps

Contribute similarity metrics to skimage
