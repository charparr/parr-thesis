# TODO

##### 5.21.2018
###### Validation
1. Use validation result shapefiles to query terrain information for error analysis
  1. ~~Utlity script to sample raster(s) with points and write result.~~
  2. ~~Update GDAL terrain scripts to push 0 instead of -9999 for no data on slope, etc.~~
  3. ~~Generate pairplot of errors vs. terrain factors~~
  4. Make it several plots instead of pairplot...
  5. Smart names from study area args
  6. Include in bash script
  4. Decide what to do about HV 2016 where no validation data exist.
2. Write Validation report.
  1. Introduction of data
  2. Methods
  3. Report on results, table
  4. Further error investigation
  5. Discussion


###### Figures
1. Make a utility to plot single and multi rasters

###### Analysis
1. ~~Generate corrected rasters via validation script~~
2. Create stack of depth dDEMS
