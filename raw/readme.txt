In this folder you will find two types of files:

1.) .las files which represent point clouds generated from airborne lidar
acquisitions. At Happy Valley there are three lidar files: 1 snow-free file
from 2012 and 2 snow-on files from 2012 and 2013. At CLPX there are 4 lidar
files: 2 snow-free files acquired on consectutive days in 2012, and 2 snow-on
files from 2012 and 2013.

2.) GeoTiff raster files which represent gridded surfaces. These were generated
using structure-from-motion photogrammetry and processed from the original
aerial photos by Chris Larsen.

The source of these files is Chris Larsen's ftp site:
